    "\n",
    "Summary of approaches:\n",
    "- Solution 1: Single binary search function with a `leftBias` flag. Runs two binary searches (left and right bias). Time O(log n). Space O(1). Good balance between code reuse and clarity.\n",
    "- Solution 2: Two explicit helper functions (`find_left_occurence` and `find_right_occurence`). Equally efficient: two O(log n) searches -> overall O(log n). Slightly clearer intent and easier to test individually.\n",
    "- Solution 3: Linear scan. Time O(n), Space O(1). Simple to implement but does not meet the problem's O(log n) requirement for large n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact complexity values (for array length n):\n",
    "- Binary-search solutions: at most 2 * ⌈log2(n+1)⌉ iterations total across the two searches. Each iteration is O(1) so exact upper bound on primitive operations is c * 2 * ⌈log2(n+1)⌉ for some small constant c. This is asymptotically O(log n).\n",
    "- Linear scan: exactly n iterations in worst case (one comparison per element), O(n) time.\n",
    "- Space for all solutions: O(1) extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why modified binary search differs from normal binary search:\n",
    "- Normal binary search stops when it finds any occurrence and returns. Modified boundary searches must continue after finding a match to search for earlier or later occurrences. We do this by recording the current `mid` into a result variable and moving the search boundary (`high` or `low`) to continue searching inside the remaining half. This minor change preserves the logarithmic iteration count but yields boundary indices instead of an arbitrary matching index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation:\n",
    "- For this LeetCode problem prefer Solution 2 (clear intent) or Solution 1 (compact reuse). Use Solution 3 only if O(n) is acceptable or for quick prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing suggestions:\n",
    "- Test empty input `[]`, single-element arrays, arrays where all elements equal target, arrays where target is not present, target smaller than all elements, and target larger than all elements.\n",
    "- Consider writing short unit tests using `pytest` to cover these cases and validate both binary-search approaches return identical outputs."
