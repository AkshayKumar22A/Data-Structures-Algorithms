    "# Bubble Sort: Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-life Example\n",
    "Imagine you are sorting a stack of books by height. You repeatedly compare each pair of adjacent books and swap them if they are in the wrong order. After each pass, the tallest book \"bubbles up\" to the end of the stack. You repeat this process for all books until the stack is sorted. This is how bubble sort works: repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are out of order.\n",

    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of numbers, sort the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Intuition and Approach\n",
    "Bubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Each pass through the array places the next largest element in its correct position, like bubbles rising to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in the Approach\n",
    "- Start from the beginning of the array.\n",
    "- Compare each pair of adjacent elements.\n",
    "- If the first is greater than the second, swap them.\n",
    "- Repeat for all elements, reducing the range by one each time (since the last elements are already sorted).\n",
    "- Continue until no swaps are needed in a pass (array is sorted).\n",

    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "- **Outer Loop (`for i in range(n)`):** Controls the number of passes. After each pass, the largest unsorted element is placed at its correct position.\n",
    "- **Inner Loop (`for j in range(0, n-i-1)`):** Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if needed.\n",
    "- **Swapping:** If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.\n",
    "- **Early Exit (`if not swapped: break`):** If no swaps occurred in a pass, the array is already sorted, so exit early for efficiency.\n",

    "## In-Place Sorting Explanation\n",
    "**In-place sorting** means the algorithm rearranges the elements within the original array, using only a constant amount of extra memory. Bubble sort is in-place because it swaps elements directly in the input array, without needing to create a copy or use extra data structures. This makes it memory efficient and suitable for environments with limited space.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stability of Bubble Sort\n",
    "**Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm.**\n",
    "Stability means that equal elements retain their relative order after sorting. In bubble sort, swapping only occurs between adjacent elements, so equal elements never move past each other. This preserves their original order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "Bubble sort is simple and intuitive, but not efficient for large datasets. It is useful for small arrays or when memory is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In-place: Yes\n",
    "- Stable: Yes\n",
    "- Time: O(n²) (O(n) best case)\n",
    "- Space: O(1)\n",
    "- Best for: Small datasets, memory-constrained environments\n"
