    "# Insertion Sort: Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-life Example\n",
    "Imagine sorting a hand of playing cards. You pick up cards one by one and insert each into its correct position among the cards you have already sorted. You shift cards as needed to make space for the new card. This is exactly how insertion sort works: it builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of numbers, sort the array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition and Approach\n",
    "Insertion sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly takes the first unsorted element and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted part, shifting elements as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in the Approach\n",
    "- Start from the second element (first is considered sorted).\n",
    "- For each element, compare it with elements in the sorted portion (to its left).\n",
    "- Shift all larger elements one position to the right.\n",
    "- Insert the current element into its correct position.\n",
    "- Repeat until the entire array is sorted.\n",

    "### Step-by-step Code Explanation\n",
    "- **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, len(arr))`):**\n",
    "    - Iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1), as the first element is assumed to be sorted.\n",
    "- **Key Initialization (`key = arr[i]`):**\n",
    "    - The current element to be inserted into the sorted portion is stored in the variable `key`.\n",
    "- **Index Tracking (`j = i - 1`):**\n",
    "    - `j` points to the last element of the sorted portion, used to compare with the `key`.\n",
    "- **Inner While Loop (`while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key`):**\n",
    "    - This loop shifts elements in the sorted portion to the right as long as they are greater than the `key`.\n",
    "    - The loop terminates when `j < 0` or when an element smaller than or equal to the `key` is found.\n",
    "- **Element Insertion (`arr[j + 1] = key`):**\n",
    "    - Once the correct position for the `key` is found, it is placed in that position.\n",
