    "# Selection Sort: Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-life Example\n",
    "Imagine sorting a deck of cards in your hand. You look for the smallest card, place it at the beginning, then look for the next smallest among the remaining cards, and so on. This is how selection sort works: repeatedly select the minimum and move it to its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of numbers, sort the array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Intuition and Approach\n",
    "Selection sort divides the array into a sorted and unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element, growing the sorted part by one each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in the Approach\n",
    "- Start with the first element as the current minimum.\n",
    "- Compare it with every other element in the unsorted portion of the array.\n",
    "- If a smaller element is found, update the current minimum index.\n",
    "- Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted portion.\n",
    "- Move the boundary of the sorted and unsorted portions by one and repeat until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Code Explanation in Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "- **Outer Loop (`for i in range(0, n)`):** Iterates through the array, considering each element as the current minimum.\n",
    "- **Initialization of `min_index`:** Stores the index of the smallest element in the unsorted portion. Initially set to `i`.\n",
    "- **Inner Loop (`for j in range(i + 1, n)`):** Iterates through the unsorted portion, updating `min_index` if a smaller element is found.\n",
    "- **Swapping:** After finding the smallest element, swap it with the element at index `i`.\n",
    "- **Repeat Until Sorted:** The boundary between sorted and unsorted moves forward each iteration until the array is sorted.\n",

    "## In-Place Sorting Explanation\n",
    "**In-place sorting** means the algorithm rearranges the elements within the original array, using only a constant amount of extra memory. Selection sort is in-place because it swaps elements directly in the input array, without needing to create a copy or use extra data structures. This makes it memory efficient and suitable for environments with limited space.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stability of Selection Sort\n",
    "**Selection sort is not a stable sorting algorithm.**\n",
    "Stability means that equal elements retain their relative order after sorting. In selection sort, swapping can move equal elements past each other, changing their original order. For example, if two '4's appear in different positions, their order may be reversed after sorting. If stability is required, consider using a stable algorithm like insertion sort or merge sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "Selection sort is simple and intuitive, but not efficient for large datasets. It is useful for small arrays or when memory is limited.\n",

    "- Stable: No\n",
    "- Time: O(n²)\n",
    "- Space: O(1)\n",
    "- Best for: Small datasets, memory-constrained environments\n"
