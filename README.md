## About

This repository contains Python implementations of popular data structures and algorithms, with:
- Detailed explanations for each problem
- Step-by-step dry runs
- Edge case and complexity analysis
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning
Each notebook and solution follows a consistent format:
1. **Problem Statement**
2. **Intuition and Approach**
3. **Code Explanation in Details**
4. **Dry Run**
5. **Edge Cases**
6. **Time and Space Complexity**
This helps you understand not just the code, but the reasoning and trade-offs behind each solution.
