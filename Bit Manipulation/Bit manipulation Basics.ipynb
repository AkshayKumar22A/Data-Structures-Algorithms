    "# Bit Manipulation Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits (0s and 1s) directly. It is essential for low-level programming, device drivers, cryptography, and writing highly optimized code. Understanding bit operations is crucial for optimizing algorithms, reducing memory usage, and improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers store integers as binary numbers—a sequence of 0s and 1s. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2. In Python, you can visualize the binary representation using the `bin()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Converting Decimal to Binary**\n",
    "- Decimal: 10\n",
    "- Binary: `1010` \n",
    "- Calculation: $1 \\times 2^3 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0 = 8 + 2 = 10$\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(bin(x))  # Output: '0b1010' (The '0b' prefix indicates binary)\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Bitwise Operators\n",

    "Bitwise operators are the fundamental tools for bit manipulation. They perform logical operations directly on the binary representations of integers.\n",

    "| OR | `\\|` | Returns 1 if **at least one** bit is 1 | `5 \\| 3` = `0111` (**7**) |\n",
    "| XOR | `^` | Returns 1 if 1 bits are **Odd** | `5 ^ 3` = `0110` (**6**) |\n",
    "| NOT | `~` | **Inverts** all bits (0→1, 1→0) | `~5` = **-6** (two's complement) |\n",
    "| Left Shift | `<<` | Shifts bits **left**, fills with 0 | `5 << 1` = `1010` (**10**) |\n",
    "| Right Shift | `>>` | Shifts bits **right**, discards rightmost bits | `5 >> 1` = `0010` (**2**) |\n",

    "## Common Problem Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find Missing/Unique:**\n",
    "   - XOR all elements → missing/unique remains\n",
    "   - Example: Missing number in [0, n]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subset Generation:**\n",
    "   - Use integers 0 to $2^n - 1$ as bitmasks\n",
    "   - Check bit i to include/exclude element i\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bit Counting:**\n",
    "   - Use Kernighan's algorithm: `n & (n-1)` removes rightmost 1\n",
    "   - Much faster than checking all bits\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parity/Position:**\n",
    "   - Even: `n & 1 == 0`\n",
    "   - Odd: `n & 1 == 1`\n",
    "   - Power of 2: `(n & (n-1)) == 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bit Extraction:**\n",
    "   - Single bit: `(n >> i) & 1`\n",
    "   - Rightmost bit: `n & (-n)`\n",
    "   - Lower k bits: `n & ((1 << k) - 1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Powers of 2:**\n",
    "- Only one bit set: `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...` = `1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, ...` (binary)\n",
    "- Check: `(n & (n-1)) == 0 && n > 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two's Complement:**\n",
    "- Negative numbers represented with infinite 1s to the left\n",
    "- `-n = ~n + 1`\n",
    "- Python handles this automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bit Distribution:**\n",
    "- $2^k$ has bits from position 0 to k-1 potentially set\n",
    "- $(2^k - 1)$ has exactly k bits set (rightmost k ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python-Specific Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infinite Precision:** No overflow in Python (unlike C++/Java)\n",
    "2. **32-bit Simulation:** Use `x & 0xFFFFFFFF` for problems expecting 32-bit behavior\n",
    "3. **Negative Numbers:** Extended infinitely with 1s (two's complement)\n",
    "4. **Efficiency:** Bit operations are $O(1)$ per operation, very fast\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Bit Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use when:**\n",
    "- Need high performance with large datasets\n",
    "- Working with small constraint problems ($N \\leq 20$)\n",
    "- Solving subset/bitmask DP problems\n",
    "- Optimizing space usage\n",
    "- Finding unique/missing elements\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Avoid when:**\n",
    "- Code clarity is more important than performance\n",
    "- Working with large bitmask sizes ($N > 30$)\n",
    "- Team isn't familiar with bit operations"
