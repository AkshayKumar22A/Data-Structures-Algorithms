    "## Fast & Slow Pointers (single pass)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition and approach\n",
    "- Use two pointers: `fast` moves two steps at a time, `slow` moves one step. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` is at the middle.\n",
    "- To satisfy the requirement \n",
    ", this implementation advances `slow` once more when the `fast` pointer has exactly one node remaining (i.e., `fast.next` exists but `fast.next.next` does not).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fast = slow = head`: both pointers start at the list head.\n",
    "- `while fast.next and fast.next.next:`: loop while `fast` can advance two steps; this ensures we don't dereference `None`. Each iteration advances `fast` by 2 and `slow` by 1.\n",
    "- After the loop, `slow` points to the first middle for even-length lists (and actual middle for odd-length lists). The `if fast.next:` check detects the case where there is an extra node after `fast` (i.e., even length) and moves `slow` one step to return the second middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dry run — odd length (complete, step-by-step): nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "- n = 5. Initialization: `fast=1`, `slow=1`. Loop condition checks `fast.next` and `fast.next.next` (both exist).\n",
    "Iteration 1: fast -> 3 (1->3), slow -> 2 (1->2).\n",
    "Iteration 2: fast -> 5 (3->5), slow -> 3 (2->3).\n",
    "Next check: fast is at 5; `fast.next` is None so loop exits. `fast.next` is False, so we do NOT advance `slow`. Return `slow` which points to node with value 3.\n",
    "Exact iteration count: floor((n-1)/2) = floor((5-1)/2) = 2 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dry run — even length (complete, step-by-step): nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n",
    "- n = 6. Initialization: `fast=1`, `slow=1`.\n",
    "Iteration 1: fast -> 3, slow -> 2.\n",
    "Iteration 2: fast -> 5, slow -> 3.\n",
    "Next check: fast is at 5; `fast.next` exists (node 6) but `fast.next.next` is None so loop stops. The `if fast.next:` condition is True, so advance `slow` once: slow -> 4. Return node value 4 (the second middle).\n",
    "Exact iteration count in loop: floor((n-1)/2) = floor((6-1)/2) = 2 iterations; plus one conditional advance of `slow` to pick the second middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge cases and behavior\n",
    "- Empty list: problem constraints say at least 1 node, but if `head` could be `None` the code would raise an AttributeError on `fast.next`. Add a guard `if not head: return None` if you need to support empty lists.\n",
    "- Single node: loop condition false immediately, `fast.next` is None so we return `slow=head` — correct.\n",
    "- Two nodes [a,b]: loop condition false (fast.next exists but fast.next.next is None), `if fast.next` True -> `slow` advances from a to b -> returns second node (correct per spec).\n",
    "- Works with negative values or arbitrary node values because it only uses relative positions, not values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and space complexity (exact)\n",
    "- Let n be the number of nodes. The `while` loop runs exactly floor((n-1)/2) iterations. Each iteration does O(1) work (two pointer moves and constant checks). After loop there may be one additional `slow` move. So the exact pointer-movement count is floor((n-1)/2) * (2 pointer moves for `fast` + 1 for `slow`) plus at most one extra `slow` move — still Θ(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single pass, minimal pointer operations, and returns the second middle for even-length lists with a tiny, explicit adjustment. It is the standard and efficient approach for this problem.### Why this is preferred- Space: O(1) extra space (only two pointers and a few locals).- Asymptotic: Best case: O(1) when n=1 (only constant-time work). Average and worst case: Θ(n) (in particular ≈ n/2 pointer steps).                "

    "- Space: O(1) extra space.\n",

    "### When to choose this vs fast/slow\n",
    "- Two-pass is simple and easy to reason about; it is slightly less efficient in pointer moves (~1.5n vs ~n/2 iterations for the loop of the fast/slow method) but still linear time. Fast/slow is preferred for single-pass minimal traversal."
