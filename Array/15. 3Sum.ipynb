    "## Solution 1 — Two-pointer after sorting (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition and Approach\n",
    "Sort the array first. For each index `i`, we look for pairs `(j, k)` with `j > i` and `k > j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`. After sorting, we can use the two-pointer technique for the subarray to the right of `i`: start `j = i+1` and `k = n-1` and move pointers inward depending on the sum.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Initialize two pointers `j = i+1` and `k = n-1` and while `j < k` compute `total_sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]`.\n",
    "  - If `total_sum < 0`: increase `j` to make sum larger.\n",
    "  - If `total_sum > 0`: decrease `k` to make sum smaller.\n",
    "  - If `total_sum == 0`: record triplet `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` into answer, then move both pointers (`j += 1`, `k -= 1`) and skip duplicates by advancing while equal to previous values.\n",
