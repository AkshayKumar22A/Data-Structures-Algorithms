    "# Lower Bound (Binary Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "Find the index of the first element in a sorted array `nums` that is ≥ `target`.\n",
    "If the target is present multiple times, lower bound returns the left-most index where `nums[i] == target`.\n",
    "If all elements are smaller than `target`, a convention used here returns `len(nums)-1` or the last updated `lb` depending on implementation; see notes below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition and Approach:\n",
    "- Binary search narrows the search window by half each iteration.\n",
    "- For lower bound we move the `end` pointer left when `nums[mid] >= target` because we may still find an earlier index that satisfies the condition.\n",
    "- Otherwise we move `start` right to skip values less than `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Explanation (line-by-line):\n",
    "- `start = 0`, `end = len(nums) - 1`: initialize the search bounds.\n",
    "- `lb = end`: initialize lower-bound variable. It's updated when we find a candidate mid. (Some implementations init to `len(nums)` as a sentinel.)\n",
    "- Loop `while start <= end`: standard binary search loop.\n",
    "- `mid = start + (end - start) // 2`: safe midpoint calculation.\n",
    "- If `nums[mid] >= target`: this mid could be the lower bound, so set `lb = mid` and move `end = mid - 1` to continue searching left side.\n",
    "- Else `start = mid + 1` to search right side.\n",
    "- Return `lb`: the index of the first element >= target according to this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dry Run (complete) with example: `nums = [1,1,1,1,3,5,8,7,7,15,19]`, `target = 1`:\n",
    "Note: the example array is not strictly sorted due to `8,7,7` — binary search requires a sorted array. For a correct dry run we assume sorted input such as `[1,1,1,1,3,5,7,7,8,15,19]`. Using that sorted array: \n",
    "1) start=0, end=10, lb=10 -> mid=5 (value 5). 5 >= 1 so lb=5, end=4.\n",
    "2) start=0, end=4 -> mid=2 (value 1). 1 >= 1 so lb=2, end=1.\n",
    "3) start=0, end=1 -> mid=0 (value 1). 1 >= 1 so lb=0, end=-1.\n",
    "Loop ends. Return lb=0 — the left-most index of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases / Potential Pitfalls:\n",
    "- Empty array: `len(nums) == 0` -> current code will set `end = -1` and the loop will skip; `lb` is initialized to `end` and returns -1. Consider returning a sentinel like `-1` or `len(nums)` depending on your API.\n",
    "- Target smaller than all elements: returns the first index 0 (if implementation updates correctly) or `end` sentinel in some variants.\n",
    "- Target greater than all elements: typical lower_bound returns `len(nums)` (not found position after last). This implementation initializes `lb = end`, so it may return last index — be careful and choose the convention you want.\n",
    "- Unsorted input: binary search requires sorted input; results are undefined otherwise. The example array in the code has unsorted region and should be sorted first.\n",
    "- Negative numbers / zeros: algorithm works unchanged as long as array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity (exact):\n",
    "- Best case: O(1) comparisons if you consider a target that is found at mid on first try, but the loop still runs at least once; more formally the number of loop iterations is floor(log2(n))+1 in worst case.\n",
    "- Average / Worst case: O(log n) where n = len(nums). Number of iterations is at most ⌈log2(n+1)⌉.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1) — only a few pointers and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact operation counts (rough): each loop does one comparison `nums[mid] >= target` and updates two pointers; iterations ≈ ⌈log2(n)⌉."
