    "## Solution 1 — Using extra row and column trackers (O(m + n) space)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement (short)\n",
    "Given an `m x n` integer matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0` in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition and Approach\n",
    "The straightforward idea is to first find which rows and which columns must become zero — record that information — and then in a second pass set those rows/columns to 0.\n",
    "We can store two auxiliary arrays: `rowtrack` of length `m` and `coltrack` of length `n`. When we see a `0` at position `(i,j)` we mark `rowtrack[i]` and `coltrack[j]`. After the first pass we know exactly which rows and columns should be zeroed; a second pass applies those marks to the matrix in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method uses O(m + n) extra space and does two full passes over the matrix (plus O(1) work per cell), giving O(m*n) time. It is clean, easy to reason about, and fast enough for typical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code explanation (line-by-line)\n",
    "- `row = len(matrix)` and `col = len(matrix[0])` — read dimensions. Assumes non-empty rectangular matrix.\n",
    "- `rowtrack = [0 for _ in range(row)]` and `coltrack = [0 for _ in range(col)]` — initialize trackers with 0. We'll mark positions with `-1` when a zero is found.\n",
    "- First nested loop: iterate every `(i,j)`; when `matrix[i][j] == 0` set `rowtrack[i] = -1` and `coltrack[j] = -1`. This records which rows/cols must be zeroed.\n",
    "- Second nested loop: for each cell `(a,b)` if `rowtrack[a] == -1 or coltrack[b] == -1` then set `matrix[a][b] = 0`. This applies the zeroing in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dry run (edge case) — single zero in a small matrix with negative numbers\n",
    "Use matrix = [[-1, 0], [2, 3]] — tests negative values and ensures only proper row/col are zeroed.\n",
    "Initial: `matrix = [[-1, 0], [2, 3]]`\n",
    "- row = 2, col = 2\n",
    "- rowtrack = [0, 0], coltrack = [0, 0] initially.\n",
    "First pass: scan cells: \n",
    "  (0,0) = -1 -> not zero; trackers unchanged.\n",
    "  (0,1) = 0 -> mark rowtrack[0] = -1, coltrack[1] = -1. Now rowtrack = [-1,0], coltrack = [0,-1].\n",
    "  (1,0) = 2 and (1,1) = 3 -> not zero.\n",
    "Second pass: apply marks:\n",
    "  For (0,0): rowtrack[0] == -1 -> set matrix[0][0] = 0.\n",
    "  For (0,1): marked -> stays 0.\n",
    "  For (1,0): rowtrack[1] != -1 but coltrack[0] != -1 -> remains 2.\n",
    "  For (1,1): coltrack[1] == -1 -> set matrix[1][1] = 0.\n",
    "Final matrix: [[0,0],[2,0]] — correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge cases to consider\n",
    "- Empty matrix or zero-sized dimensions (the code assumes at least one row and one column). Guard with checks if needed.\n",
    "- Jagged input (rows of unequal length) — this code assumes rectangular input (`len(matrix[0])` valid for all rows).\n",
    "- All zeros (works fine: trackers mark all rows/cols and final matrix remains all zeros).\n",
    "- Negative numbers or any integer values are fine; we only compare to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space complexity (exact)\n",
    "- Time: We do two full passes over the matrix of size `m*n` with O(1) work per cell -> exact time O(m * n).\n",
    "  - Best case: O(m*n) (even if no zeros, we still scan matrix twice).\n",
    "  - Average case: O(m*n).\n",
    "  - Worst case: O(m*n).\n",
    "- Space: O(m + n) for `rowtrack` and `coltrack` arrays (exact). Apart from these arrays, space is O(1) extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this solution\n",
    "- Use when you want a simple, robust, and memory-efficient solution compared to the naive O(m*n) extra space. It is often the go-to solution unless the follow-up strictly requires O(1) extra space."

    "## Solution 2 — In-place marking using `float('inf')` (O(1) extra space idea but with caveats)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement (short)\n",
    "Same problem: set entire row and column to zero if an element is zero, modifying the matrix in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition and Approach\n",
    "Instead of using separate tracking arrays, we can attempt to mark cells temporarily inside the matrix itself with a sentinel value that can't be confused with valid input values. One such sentinel is `float('inf')` (infinity). The algorithm is: when we find a `0`, mark every non-zero cell in that row and column with `inf`. After processing all zeros, convert every `inf` to `0` in a final pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids `O(m + n)` extra arrays, but it has important caveats: if the input can contain `float('inf')` (unlikely for integer-only problems but theoretically possible if using other sentinel choices), this will conflict. Also using a floating sentinel mixes types (float vs int). It is usually safer in CP to use `None`/large sentinel only if you are certain it won't conflict with valid values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code explanation (line-by-line)\n",
    "- `markInfinity`: helper that marks every non-zero element in the specified row or column with `float('inf')`. It checks `if matrix[i][col] != 0` to avoid overwriting original zeros.\n",
    "- `setZeroes`: iterates over the matrix, calling `markInfinity` for each cell that is originally `0`. After this pass, any cell that should become zero but wasn't originally zero will be `inf`. The final loop replaces `float('inf')` with `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dry run (edge case) — matrix with zeros and existing large integers\n",
    "Use matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]] (matches example).\n",
    "Initial: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]\n",
    "- First zero at (0,0): mark row 0 and col 0 (non-zero entries) with `inf`: row 0's non-zero entries at (0,1),(0,2); col 0's non-zero entries at (1,0),(2,0).\n",
    "- Next zero at (0,3): mark non-zero in row 0 and col 3 -> row 0 cells already processed; column 3 mark (1,3),(2,3) as `inf`.\n",
    "- Any further zero encountered will cause markInfinity but the `!= 0` check prevents converting zeros to `inf`.\n",
    "- After marking pass, convert all `inf` to 0 in final pass and you obtain the expected result: `[[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge cases and caveats\n",
    "- If any valid matrix element is `float('inf')` already, this method will fail because we can't distinguish sentinel from valid data. However, CP inputs are integers; mixing float sentinel is safe only if you're sure input will always be integers and not `inf`.\n",
    "- Using float sentinel mixes types (float vs int). Some strict type-sensitive code or comparisons might behave oddly, though Python handles numeric comparisons between ints and floats.\n",
    "- If values can be extremely large integers, picking a large integer sentinel might be safer than `inf`, but that also risks collisions. The safest robust approach remains the `O(m + n)` trackers or the constant-space technique that uses first row/column as markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space complexity (exact)\n",
    "- Time: The algorithm marks entire rows and columns when it sees a zero. In the worst case (many zeros), `markInfinity` may be called O(k) times and each call can be O(m + n) — but aggregated over the matrix each cell is revisited multiple times. Simplify by noting the algorithm consists of: for each zero encountered, marking its row and column (O(m + n)); we can bound worst-case work by O(Z * (m + n)) where Z is number of zeros. In the pathological case where Z = O(m*n) (almost every cell is zero), this becomes O(m*n*(m+n)) which is worse than O(m*n). Practically for typical inputs it's acceptable, but worst-case complexity is high.\n",
    "  - Best case: O(m * n) when there are no zeros (single scan plus final scan) or zeros are few and marking overlaps are minimal.\n",
    "  - Average case: depends on zero distribution; analysis is input dependent.\n",
    "  - Worst case: O(Z * (m + n)) which can be O(m*n*(m+n)) if Z is Theta(m*n). Therefore this method is not robust worst-case.\n",
    "- Space: O(1) extra (in-place), ignoring the sentinel type mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this solution\n",
    "- Use only if you are certain input values are integers and marking with `float('inf')` can't conflict, and the matrix size/distribution of zeros won't produce pathological worst-case time. Otherwise, prefer the `O(m + n)` tracker solution or the standard constant-space solution that uses first row and column as markers."
