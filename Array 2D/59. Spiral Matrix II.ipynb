    "## Solution — Layer-by-layer (boundary) filling (spiral)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition and Approach\n",
    "Think of filling the `n x n` matrix in concentric layers (or rings). Maintain four boundaries: `rowmin` (top), `rowmax` (bottom), `colmin` (left) and `colmax` (right).\n",
    "At each step you fill one side of the current boundary in this order:\n",
    "1. Top row, left -> right (row = rowmin, cols colmin..colmax)\n",
    "2. Right column, top -> bottom (col = colmax, rows rowmin+1..rowmax)\n",
    "3. Bottom row, right -> left (row = rowmax, cols colmax-1..colmin)\n",
    "4. Left column, bottom -> top (col = colmin, rows rowmax-1..rowmin+1)\n",
    "After each side is filled, advance the corresponding boundary inward (increment `rowmin`, decrement `colmax`, etc.). Continue until you've placed all numbers from `1` to `n*n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach guarantees each cell is written exactly once, and the boundaries ensure you never overwrite previously written values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code explanation (detailed, matching the cell)\n",
    "- `result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]`: allocate output `n x n` filled with zeros.\n",
    "- `if n == 0: return result`: guard for zero (though problem guarantees n >= 1). Keeps code robust.\n",
    "- Initialize boundaries: `rowmin = 0`, `rowmax = n-1`, `colmin = 0`, `colmax = n-1`.\n",
    "- `count = 1`: the current value to place; we will place values up to `n*n`.\n",
    "- `while count <= (n * n):` the main loop continues until all numbers are placed. Using `count` as the loop sentinel avoids over-writes and handles odd/even n uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the loop there are four phases (each implemented with a `while` loop and a boundary update):\n",
    "1) Fill top row: `i = colmin` then `while i <= colmax and count <= n*n:` set `result[rowmin][i] = count`, increment `count` and `i`. After finishing top row do `rowmin += 1`.\n",
    "2) Fill right column: `j = rowmin` then `while j <= rowmax and count <= n*n:` set `result[j][colmax] = count`, increment `count` and `j`. After finishing right column do `colmax -= 1`.\n",
    "3) Fill bottom row: `k = colmax` then `while k >= colmin and count <= n*n:` set `result[rowmax][k] = count`, increment `count` and decrement `k`. After finishing bottom row do `rowmax -= 1`.\n",
    "4) Fill left column: `l = rowmax` then `while l >= rowmin and count <= n*n:` set `result[l][colmin] = count`, increment `count` and decrement `l`. After finishing left column do `colmin += 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on the `count <= n*n` checks: they are required inside each inner loop to handle the final partial side when `n*n` is reached (especially important for odd `n` when the final center element is placed). Without these checks you could write beyond the required final value or overwrite values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dry run (edge case): n = 1 (smallest allowed)\n",
    "Input: `n = 1`. Expect `[[1]]`.\n",
    "- Initialize `result = [[0]]`, `rowmin = 0`, `rowmax = 0`, `colmin = 0`, `colmax = 0`, `count = 1`.\n",
    "- Enter main while: `count <= 1` is true.\n",
    "  * Top row phase: `i = colmin = 0`, `i <= colmax` holds. Set `result[rowmin][0] = 1`. Now `result = [[1]]`. Increment `count` to 2, `i` to 1. Exit inner top-row loop because `i > colmax` or `count > n*n`. Update `rowmin = 1`.\n",
    "  * Right column phase: `j = rowmin = 1`, but `j <= rowmax` is false (1 <= 0 false) so skip. Update `colmax = -1`.\n",
    "  * Bottom row and left column phases similarly skip because boundaries crossed or `count > n*n`.\n",
    "- Main while ends because `count = 2 > n*n`. Return `[[1]]` — correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dry run demonstrates the boundary updates and `count` checks prevent extra writes and handle the single-center-case elegantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge cases & potential pitfalls\n",
    "- n == 0: problem statement restricts n >= 1, but code includes a guard returning an empty `0x0` matrix if invoked.\n",
    "- n == 1: handled correctly (single center).\n",
    "- Even vs odd n: odd n leaves a single center cell filled on the final partial side; the `count <= n*n` checks avoid overfilling.\n",
    "- Large n within constraints (n <= 20) — runtime and memory are safe. If n were much larger, this algorithm still remains optimal asymptotically but memory O(n^2) could be a concern.\n",
    "- Negative or zero values: the algorithm generates values from 1..n^2; input does not matter here since the function generates a fresh matrix. No negative-number handling required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity (exact)\n",
    "- Let n be input size (matrix is n x n). The algorithm writes exactly `n * n` values (each assignment increments `count` once). Thus the number of elementary assignments is `n^2`. The overhead of loop checks and boundary updates is Theta(n^2) as well.\n",
    "  - Time complexity (best, average, worst): Theta(n^2). More precisely, O(n^2) time and Ω(n^2) — so Theta(n^2).\n",
    "- Space complexity: we allocate an `n x n` result matrix -> exact extra space Theta(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final notes and small improvements\n",
    "- The implementation is clear and robust. One small stylistic improvement is to use `for` loops for each side (e.g., `for i in range(colmin, colmax+1):`) instead of `while` to simplify readability. However, the `while` with `count` checks is explicit and safe.\n",
    "- Because the function generates the matrix, there are no external inputs to validate (other than `n`), so error handling is minimal."
