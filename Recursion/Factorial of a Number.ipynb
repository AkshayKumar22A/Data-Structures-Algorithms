    "### 2. Intuition and Approach\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "To calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer N efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Factorial:**\n",
    "- Base Cases:\n",
    "  - 0! = 1\n",
    "  - 1! = 1\n",
    "- Recursive Case:\n",
    "  - For N > 1, N! = N × (N-1)!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach Overview:**\n",
    "The problem is a classic example of recursion, where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Here's how recursion applies to calculating factorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Function (func):**\n",
    "  - The function func is designed to compute the factorial of a given number num.\n",
    "  - It checks for the base cases (num == 0 or num == 1) and returns 1 directly.\n",
    "  - For other values, it calls itself with num - 1 and multiplies the result by num, effectively building up the factorial product.\n",
    "- **Wrapper Function (factorial):**\n",
    "  - The factorial function serves as an interface to the recursive func.\n",
    "  - It takes the input number N, calls func(N), and returns the computed factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Recursion Works Here:**\n",
    "- **Simplicity:**\n",
    "  - Recursion provides a straightforward way to express the factorial calculation, aligning closely with its mathematical definition.\n",
    "- **Breaking Down the Problem:**\n",
    "  - By reducing the problem size (N to N-1), recursion handles each multiplication step systematically.\n",
    "- **Handling Base Cases:**\n",
    "  - Recursion inherently manages the stopping condition through base cases, ensuring termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def func(self,num):\n",
    "        if num==1 or num==0:\n",
    "            return 1\n",
    "        return num * self.func(num-1)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def factorial(self, N):\n",
    "        ans = self.func(N)\n",
    "        return ans\n",

    "    return num * self.func(num - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- The func method is responsible for computing the factorial of the input number num recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanism:**\n",
    "- **Base Cases:**\n",
    "  - If num is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 immediately, as per the definition of factorial.\n",
    "- **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "  - For num > 1, the function calls itself with num - 1 and multiplies the result by num. This builds the factorial product step by step.\n",

    "    - Result: Potentially infinite recursion or incorrect results.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(N)\n",
    "  - The func method makes a recursive call for each integer from N down to 0.\n",
    "  - Therefore, the number of recursive calls grows linearly with N.\n",
    "  - Each call performs a constant amount of work (a multiplication and a conditional check).\n",
    "  - Overall: The time complexity scales linearly with the input size, O(N).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(N)\n",
    "  - Due to recursion, each function call adds a new frame to the call stack.\n",
    "  - For N recursive calls, the space used on the call stack grows linearly with N.\n",
    "  - Overall: The space complexity is linear, O(N), primarily due to the recursion depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "While the time complexity is optimal for calculating factorials recursively, the space complexity can be a concern for very large values of N due to potential stack overflow. Iterative solutions can achieve O(1) space complexity but may sacrifice some of the elegance and simplicity of recursion.\n"
